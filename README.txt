Day & Date Calculator
Created by Kevin Hoffman

The Day & Date calculator is a basic utility for calculating dates based number of days, or vice-versa.

The first calculator is helpful when you have two dates and you need to know how many days there are between them.

Use the second calculator when you need to know a date in the future (or past) and all you have to go on is the number of days.
